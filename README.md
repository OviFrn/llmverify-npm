## ⚙️ Using llmverify-npm
Once you have installed the application, launch it to start monitoring your AI models. Here’s how to check various aspects:

### 🔍 Drift Detection
Drift detection helps you identify if the data your model processes has changed significantly. In the main interface, access the drift detection feature. This allows you to set baselines and receive alerts if your data shows unexpected shifts.

### 🤖 Hallucination Detection
Hallucination detection checks if your AI model is producing false or misleading results. You can run this check directly within the application. llmverify-npm provides easy-to-understand feedback on your model's output quality.

### ⌛ Latency Monitoring
This feature monitors how quickly your model responds. High latency can affect user experience. llmverify-npm tracks response times and notifies you if changes occur.

### 📊 JSON/Format Quality
Ensure your data is structured correctly. llmverify-npm checks your JSON output for common formatting issues. This makes it easier for your applications to process data without errors.

## 📱 Additional Features
- **Compatibility**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, and local models.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Designed with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for non-technical users.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Get instant feedback on your model's performance at any time.
